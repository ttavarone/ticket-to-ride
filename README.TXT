How to run:  Run the main method of the PlayGame class.  This will start
the thread that runs the GUI.  The title screen will popup and you can
press start to begin the game.

Once the game begins there are only 2 players possible.  Player one will be 
represented by the color red and player two by the color blue.  Player one will
start by drawing four cards from the ticket deck on the right side of the
screen.  There are two ticket options, long routes and short routes.  The 
player will choose to keep at least one or up to all of the four ticket cards.
To choose the cards click the black box under the ticket deck that says "stop
drawing cards".  After this, player two will do the same and the game can begin.

The rules and gameplay apply the same way that they do in the regular version 
of Ticket to Ride: Germany.  Players one and two will alternate until there is
a clear win from one person.  The game will end when either all tickets are 
claimed by a player or all the routes are claimed.
